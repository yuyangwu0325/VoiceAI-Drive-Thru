## Introduction

This is the initial README file for a new native AWS project (name TBD), as part of the "2025 Quack the Code Challenge", an internal contest for building applications using Q CLI . The project, including the files below, will be implemented by the Q CLI agent, through interactive discussion with the user via the Q CLI chat interface.

## Use case

(This paragraph to be replaced with a description of the use case this project is setting out to solve, and how it will help customers/end users.)

## Value proposition

(This paragraph to be replaced with a description of the value proposition. Convince the reader why this application/solution is valuable to end users customers.)

## Development approach

When working with this project, the agent should ensure it is working within a git repo. If one is not configured yet, the agent should create one.

The agent should update and extend this README.md file with additional information about the project as development progresses, and commit changes to this file and the other planning files below as they are updated.

Working with the user, the agent will implement the project step by step, first by working out the requirements, then the design/architecture including AWS infrastructure components, then the list of tasks needed to: 1) implement the project source code and AWS infrastructure as code, 2) deploy the project to a test AWS environment, 3) run any integration tests against the deployed project.

Once all planning steps are completed and documented, and the user is ready to proceed, the agent will begin implementing the tasks one at a time until the project is completed. 

## Project layout 

* requirements.md: Defines the requirements for this project
* design.md: Defines the design and architecture for this project
* tasks.md: Lists the discrete tasks that need to be executed in order to successfully implement the project. Each task has a check box [ ] that is checked off when the task has been successfully completed. A git commit should be performed after any task is successfully completed.

Depending on the type of project the user decides to build, and at the user's discretion, the agent may suggest adding some additional files to the project layout:

* test-plan.md: Describes unit test, integration, non-functional, performance test plans as needed.
* threat-model.md: Comprehensive application security threat model for the application including security testing plan
* a11y.md: Describes the accessibility goals for the project and accessibility testing plan
