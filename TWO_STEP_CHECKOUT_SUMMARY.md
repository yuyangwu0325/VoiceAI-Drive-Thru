# GrillTalk Two-Step Checkout Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive two-step checkout process for the GrillTalk ordering system that enhances customer experience by providing clear order confirmation before payment processing.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. New `confirm_order` Action
- **Purpose**: Provides order summary and requests customer confirmation before payment
- **Response**: Returns order details with confirmation message
- **Status**: `order_confirmation` with awaiting confirmation status
- **Message**: "Please confirm your order. Say 'yes' to proceed with payment or 'no' to make changes."

### 2. Enhanced `finalize` Action
- **Purpose**: Processes payment after customer confirmation
- **Response**: Returns payment processing status with order details
- **Status**: `order_finalized` with payment processing status
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Clears order session for next customer after payment

### 3. WebSocket Integration
- **Order Confirmation**: Broadcasts confirmation status to frontend with `awaiting_confirmation` status
- **Payment Processing**: Sends finalized order with payment status
- **Screen Clearing**: Automatically clears display for next customer

## Implementation Details

### Function Schema Update
```python
"action": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "Action to take with this order: 'add_item' to add items to the current order, 'update_items' to update existing items (e.g., make them combos), 'confirm_order' to show order summary and ask for confirmation, 'finalize' to complete payment after customer confirms, 'new_order' to start a new order, or 'clear' to cancel the current order",
    "enum": ["add_item", "update_items", "confirm_order", "finalize", "new_order", "clear"],
    "default": "add_item"
}
```

### Order Confirmation Flow
1. **Customer completes ordering**: "I'm done ordering"
2. **System calls**: `confirm_order` action
3. **Response**: Order summary with confirmation request
4. **Customer confirms**: "Yes, that's correct"
5. **System calls**: `finalize` action
6. **Response**: Payment processing and order completion

### Error Handling
- **No Active Order**: Returns error message when trying to confirm non-existent order
- **Order Validation**: Ensures order has items before confirmation
- **Session Management**: Proper cleanup after payment processing

## Test Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suite (4/4 Tests Passing)
1. **Order Confirmation Step**: ✅ Verifies confirmation response and order persistence
2. **Payment Processing and Clearing**: ✅ Tests payment flow and session cleanup
3. **Complete Checkout Workflow**: ✅ End-to-end checkout process validation
